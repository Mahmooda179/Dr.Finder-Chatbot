# Dr.Finder-Chatbot

ABOUT:
Chatbot that helps users find doctors in their area based on custom needs and preferences

This chatbot uses a JSON file to go through a list of already provided doctors. (A future update can be to create an algorithm that uses APIs to grab doctor info and place them in the JSON file). 

If statements and regex are used to evaluate user's input and determine if it is accurate and user can move on to the next dialogue state. 

LANGUAGE:
Python 3.8

RUN: 
Download "chatbot.py" and "doctors.json" in same run using the command - 'python3 chatbot.py'
